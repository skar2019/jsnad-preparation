# Module System Practice Questions

## 1. String Manipulation Module
Write a Node.js module (utils.js) that exports functions for string manipulation (e.g., capitalize, reverse). Import it into a main script and use the functions to process user input, handling invalid inputs appropriately.

## 2. Authentication Module
Create a Node.js module (auth.js) that exports a function to validate user credentials. Import it into a main script and demonstrate its use with different test cases, ensuring proper error handling for invalid credentials.

## 3. Shared Cache Module
Develop a Node.js script that imports a CommonJS module (cache.js) to store and retrieve data in a shared object. Demonstrate how the module's state is preserved across multiple require calls in different scripts.

## 4. Configuration Loading Module
Write a Node.js module (settings.js) that uses require to load a JSON configuration file and exports its contents. Handle cases where the file is missing or malformed, falling back to a default configuration object.

## 5. Multi-Module Application
Create a Node.js application that imports two CommonJS modules: one for data parsing and one for logging. Use them in a main script to process a dataset and log results, ensuring proper module organization and error handling.
