# Package.json Practice Questions

## 1. Load and Parse Package.json
Write a Node.js script that uses require to load package.json and logs its name, version, and main fields. Handle errors if the file is missing or contains invalid JSON, providing a fallback message.

## 2. Define NPM Scripts
Create a Node.js application with a package.json that defines scripts for starting a server and linting code. Write a simple server script and demonstrate running it with npm run start.

## 3. Check Dependencies
Develop a Node.js script that checks if a specific dependency (e.g., express) is listed in package.json using require. If missing, log a command to install it with npm install.

## 4. Update Package Description
Write a Node.js script that updates the description field in package.json using fs.promises.writeFile based on a command-line argument. Ensure the file is written with proper JSON formatting.

## 5. Verify Dependencies Installation
Create a Node.js script that lists all dependencies and devDependencies from package.json and verifies their installation by attempting to require each. Log any missing dependencies with their versions.
