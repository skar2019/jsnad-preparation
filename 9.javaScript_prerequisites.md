# JavaScript Prerequisites Practice Questions

## 1. Filter and Process Array
Write a JavaScript function that processes an array of mixed data types (e.g., numbers, strings, null) using a for loop and typeof to filter out non-numeric values. Return the product of the remaining numbers, handling edge cases like empty arrays or NaN.

## 2. Deep Copy Object
Create a JavaScript function that performs a deep copy of an object using recursion, supporting nested objects and arrays. Ensure it handles edge cases like null, circular references, or non-object inputs.

## 3. Parse URL String
Develop a JavaScript script that uses core string methods (e.g., substring, indexOf, toUpperCase) to parse a URL string and extract its domain name. Handle edge cases like empty strings or invalid URLs.

## 4. Private Cache with Closure
Write a JavaScript function that uses a closure to create a private cache for storing key-value pairs. Provide methods to add, retrieve, and delete entries, ensuring the cache cannot be accessed directly outside the closure.

## 5. Group Objects by Property
Create a JavaScript script that processes an array of objects using Array.prototype methods (map, filter, reduce) to group objects by a property (e.g., category) and count occurrences. Handle cases where the array is empty or properties are missing.
